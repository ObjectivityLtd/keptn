1. We prefer Prometheus over Dyntrace for Quality Gates evaluation where possible
2. We need to include perf tests and chaos engineering tests as well

    - litmus chaos
    - jmeter

    for easy start

3. We need SLOs and Quality Gates auto-evaluation and promotion (Built-in quality-gates based on SRE principles.)
4. App we deploy should be cloud native (kubernetes based?)
5. No pipeline code to push the app through
6. GitOps embraced
